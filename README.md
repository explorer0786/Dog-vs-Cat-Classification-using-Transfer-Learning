# 🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Classification using Transfer Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that distinguishes between **dogs** and **cats** using **Transfer Learning**. It leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy with reduced training time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Classifies images into **Dog** or **Cat**
- Uses **Transfer Learning** for efficient training
- Based on **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and training pipeline
- Achieves high accuracy on test data
- Easy to extend to other binary classification tasks

## 🧠 What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer Learning allows us to use a pre-trained model (trained on large datasets like ImageNet) and fine-tune it for our custom task. This saves computation time and usually yields better performance with less data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Pre-trained Models: `VGG16`, `ResNet50`, or `MobileNetV2`
- Jupyter Notebook for training and experimentation
